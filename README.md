# Liquid-Image-Transition
Today we are going to build a cool liquid image transition effect with javascript that uses gsap and three.js. GSAP is a library used to create complex transitions in javascript and three.js is a 3d library that helps us with the displacement.  Used in the video: https://github.com/robin-dela/hover-effect
